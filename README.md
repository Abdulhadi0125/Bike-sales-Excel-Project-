Bike Sales Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bike sales data to understand the factors influencing bike purchases. The dataset includes various attributes such as demographic information, income, and commute distance. The goal was to explore these variables and create a dashboard to visualize the insights.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following attributes:

ID: Unique identifier for each record.
Marital Status: Marital status of the individual (e.g., Single, Married).
Gender: Gender of the individual (e.g., Male, Female).

Purchased Bike: Whether the individual purchased a bike (e.g., Yes, No).
Steps and Process
Data Collection and Preparation

Collected raw data and imported it into Excel.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting.
Data Exploration

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables.
Generated summary statistics for numerical attributes and frequency counts for categorical attributes.
Data Analysis

Analyzed the impact of various factors (e.g., income, age, commute distance) on bike purchases.
Used pivot tables and charts to identify trends and patterns in the data.
Dashboard Creation

Designed and created an interactive dashboard using Excel.
Incorporated various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to represent different aspects of the data.
Added filters and slicers to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
Insights and Findings
